# Minimal Object Description Language (MODL) Interpreter
This Java interpreter is based on the [MODL ANTLR4 Grammar](https://github.com/MODLanguage/grammar-antlr4) and the [MODL Specification](http://www.modl.uk).

It doesn't include an API for accessing the MODL object yet (coming soon) but does provide the option of converting the MODL object to JSON â€“ which can then be accessed using the Java JSON API. To convert MODL to a JSON string: 

```java
String input = "test(message=Hello World)"; 
String json = Interpreter.parseToJson(input);
```

## HTTP Wrapper
This library includes a useful HTTP wrapper service which converts MODL to JSON. You'll need [Gradle](https://gradle.org/). Once you've downloaded the repository you can run:

    ./gradlew run
    
Then you can access the server on localhost at:

http://0.0.0.0:8080/?modl=test(message=this%20is%20a%20test%20message)

There's a very basic client in the repo at *client/index.html*


## Linking the grammar sources

Here's a quick reference regarding the import of the grammar files from the grammar repo into this project.

```
#we create a branch that we will contain the changes and they we will use for a Pull Request
git checkout -b branch-for-pr
#we connect to the grammar repo that contains the files we want
git remote add grammar git@github.com:MODLanguage/grammar
#we create a tmp branch with a copy of the grammar on master
git checkout -b removeme-export-branch grammar/master
#we extract the files we're intrested in (we don't want the whole grammar)
git subtree split --prefix antlr4 -b removeme-antlr4-branch
#we go back to our main branch for our Pull Request
git checkout branch-for-pr
#we import the file we extracted in the interpreter project
git subtree add --prefix grammar removeme-antlr4-branch
#we clean up the temporary branches and remote connection
git branch -D removeme-export-branch removeme-antlr4-branch
git remote rm grammar
```

Now we're all set to create a Pull Request on the `branch-for-pr` branch.
